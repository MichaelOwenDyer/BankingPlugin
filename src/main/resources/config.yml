# Set the daily times at which customers should receive interest payments from their accounts.
# The time zone will be that of the server, not of the individual players.
# These are real times (0 <= time < 24) written in the standard 24-hour format (for example, '00:00' for midnight, '13:45', '17:15:30', etc.).
# Equivalent values will not be counted twice.
# Type: List of times
# Default: [09:00, 12:00, 15:00, 18:00]

# Set the base interest rate for all bank accounts on the server.
# Value should be a floating point number greater than 0.
# Type: double
# Default: 0.01 (for 1% interest)
interest-rate:
    default: 0.01
    allow-override: true # This boolean determines whether or not individual banks have permission to override the default value.

# Set the consecutive interest multipliers that are applied per-player to the baseline multiplier.
# Each value represents a "stage" to be progressed through in consecutive order.
# Players advance through the multipliers by being online to collect interest more than once in a row.
# At least the first value should be 1, so that the baseline interest rate is used.
# For example: setting the sequence [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4] would result in one 1x multiplier stage,
# two 2x stages, three 3x stages, and four 4x stages.
# An account multiplier will never go past the final stage, nor further back than the first stage.
# Type: List of integers
# Default: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

    default: 0

# Set the behavior of account interest multipliers when all account holders are offline for an interest payout.
# Setting this value to X causes the multiplier to decrease by X stages per payout cycle while the player is offline.
# Setting this value to 0 causes the multiplier to freeze until the player comes back online.
# Setting this value to -1 causes the multiplier to reset on offline payouts.
# This will only trigger if neither the account owner nor any account co-owners are online at the time of the payout.
# Type: int
# Default: 0
offline-multiplier-decrement:
    default: 0
    allow-override: true

# Set the behavior of account interest multipliers when the player makes a withdrawal.
# Setting this value to X causes the multiplier to decrease by X stages per withdrawal.
# Setting this value to 0 causes the multiplier not to be affected by withdrawals.
# Setting this value to -1 causes the multiplier to reset on withdrawals.
# This will only trigger for withdrawals that bring the account balance lower than the balance at the previous payout.
# This means that a player can make a deposit and then a withdrawal of equal or lesser amount within the same payout cycle without ramifications.
# Type: int
# Default: 1

# BankingPlugin

A Minecraft plugin for earning interest on your items.

This plugin is an extension on typical economy plugins (currently only compatible with EssentialsX) that allows for the creation of physical banks and bank accounts. A player may create a bank by designating an arbitrary region in space (like the inside of that fancy skyscraper you built and then didn't know what to do with). Any chest or double chest within the region may then be used to create an account at that bank. An account holder may make a deposit simply by entering the bank and placing their valuable items into their account chest (similar to a safe deposit box). The value of those items, and thus the balance of the account, will be calculated in a manner consistent with the Worth.yml file in EssentialsX. Players will then periodically earn a portion of that value back in the form of eco-currency.

# Using BankingPlugin
BankingPlugin is designed to work on Bukkit / Spigot / Paper from 1.15 and onwards. Although there are relatively few signs that the plugin should not be compatible with earlier versions of Minecraft, usage on not officially supported versions should nevertheless be treated with caution.
Your server must be running on **Java 8 or above** for BankingPlugin to function. BankingPlugin also currently depends on **Vault and EssentialsX**.
